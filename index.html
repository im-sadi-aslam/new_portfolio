    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Pedagogical Approaches</h2>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Constructivist Learning</h4>
      <p>Students actively construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflecting on those experiences. I encourage exploration, critical thinking, and discussion in the classroom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Differentiated Instruction</h4>
      <p>Every learner is unique. I adapt my teaching methods to suit varied learning styles, abilities, and interests, ensuring each student receives personalized support.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Inquiry-Based Learning</h4>
      <p>My lessons promote curiosity and investigative learning where students pose questions, research, and share findings‚Äîleading to deeper understanding and engagement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Project-Based Learning</h4>
      <p>Real-world problems and collaborative projects form the core of my approach. This develops problem-solving skills, teamwork, and application of knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Use of Educational Technology</h4>
      <p>I integrate smart tools like Google Classroom, Kahoot, Padlet, and digital presentations to enhance interactivity, engagement, and accessibility in learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Diagnostic Assessment</h4>
      <p>Used before instruction begins, diagnostic assessments identify students' prior knowledge, skills, and learning gaps. This helps tailor teaching to individual needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-tests on grammar and vocabulary</li>
        <li>KWL charts (What students Know, Want to know, and Learned)</li>
        <li>Initial reading comprehension quizzes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Formative Assessment</h4>
      <p>Ongoing assessments during instruction that provide feedback for both teacher and student to guide learning progress.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exit tickets at the end of lessons</li>
        <li>Think-Pair-Share activities</li>
        <li>Quizzes and oral questioning</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Summative Assessment</h4>
      <p>Evaluates student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against some standard or benchmark.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Final exams or unit tests</li>
        <li>Project presentations</li>
        <li>Written assignments or research papers</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Self and Peer Assessment</h4>
      <p>Encourages students to reflect on their learning and evaluate themselves or their peers using structured criteria, fostering responsibility and metacognitive skills.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-rating checklists after tasks</li>
        <li>Peer reviews of presentations</li>
        <li>Collaborative rubrics</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Digital Assessment Tools</h4>
      <p>Utilizing technology to assess student learning in engaging, real-time, and data-driven ways.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kahoot quizzes for instant feedback</li>
        <li>Google Forms assessments with auto-grading</li>
